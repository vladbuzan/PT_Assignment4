# PT_Assignment4
The purpose of this assignment was to build a Java application that would serve
as a working interface for a restaurant. The application offers three separate user
interfaces, one for the waiter, one for the administrator and one for the chef.
Main objectives:
  - Providing three separate user interfaces for the different types of users
  - Providing each user with access to the restaurant’s resources
  - Designing data structures representing the restaurant, the menu items and the orders
  - Providing an interface for the restaurant object, allowing it to communicate with the graphical user interfaces
  - Creating an order generator whose task is to create a txt file containing billing information
  - Using serialization in order to store the state of the application
